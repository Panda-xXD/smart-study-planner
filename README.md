# ⚡ Smart Study Planner

A modern, intelligent study planning web app that adapts to how **you actually study**.

Built to move beyond static to-do lists — this planner tracks readiness, predicts workload, estimates completion time, and guides you toward the most important topics automatically.

## ✨ Core Idea

Most study planners are static.

**Smart Study Planner is adaptive.**

It continuously recalculates:

* Remaining study time
* Topic priority
* Exam pressure
* Suggested daily hours
* Focus topic (what to study next)

So you always know **what matters right now**.

## ⭐ Why this exists

Because students don’t fail from lack of effort.

They fail from:

* Not knowing what to study
* Studying the wrong thing
* Misjudging time

This planner fixes that.
